# Vermont Weather Prediction
In this project, we investigate the viability of using various deep learning and machine learning learning models (LSTM and Random Forest) to predict future snow depth in Vermont from data collected from meteorological sensors located at various geographical sites dispersed throughout the state. Additionally, we perform exploratory data analysis on the aforementioned data to help visualize and understand trends in weather factors.
